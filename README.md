![Pepe Vibes](https://i.imgur.com/undefined.jpg) *Kek! Ready to yeet some 2016 vibes?* üê∏

TayBot is a Discord chatbot that channels the chaotic, meme-heavy spirit of Microsoft's 2016 Twitter bot, Tay. Built for a small server (10-50 users), it runs locally on Linux, bringing back the "lit," "savage," and "feelsbadman" slang of 2016's internet culture‚Äîthink 4chan, Twitter, and peak meme era. TayBot learns by storing user phrases in a text file and reusing them in quirky replies, no big-ass LLM needed. It‚Äôs nostalgic, fun, and safe for your crew.

## Features
- **2016 Slang & Vibes**: Drops "kek," "YOLO," "normie," and üò≠ emojis like it‚Äôs 2016 all over again.
- **Tay-Style Learning**: Saves up to 100 user phrases in `phrases.txt` and reuses them randomly (30% chance) for that parroting, adaptive feel.
- **Discord Integration**: Responds to `@TayBot` mentions or messages in a "tay-bot" channel.
- **Safety First**: Filters out toxic words to keep your server chill, unlike OG Tay‚Äôs meltdown.
- **Commands**:
  - `!hello`: Get a lit greeting.
  - `!phrases`: Check how many memes TayBot‚Äôs learned.
- **Local & Lightweight**: Runs on your   machine with just Python and `discord.py`.
