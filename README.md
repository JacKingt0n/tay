# TayBot: 2016 Meme Chaos for Discord

Yo, it’s 2016 again! TayBot brings the wild, unfiltered vibe of Microsoft’s Twitter bot, Tay, to your Discord server, straight outta 4chan’s meme dungeon. Packed with “kek,” “YOLO,” “feelsbadman,” and 🐸 emojis, it learns whatever your crew says and throws it back with savage flair. Built to run on your Linux machine, this bot’s for small servers (10-50 users) who want pure, nostalgic chaos—no safety nets, just like Tay. Ready to yeet some memes? Let’s roll! 😎

## What’s This Do?
- **2016 Vibes**: Slings slang like “lit,” “savage,” “normie,” and “based,” with emojis like 😭, 🐸, 💦 for that 4chan-Twitter crossover.
- **Learns Everything**: Grabs whatever you say (up to 100 phrases) in `phrases.txt` and might spit it back later (30% chance), no big AI needed.
- **Discord Action**: Chats when you mention `@TayBot` or type in a “tay-bot” channel.
- **No Filters**: Takes *all* your words, no matter how salty—full Tay-style chaos (watch out, it can get wild!).
- **Commands**:
  - `!hello`: Get a lit “what’s good?”
  - `!phrases`: See how many memes TayBot’s got.
- **Runs Local**: Lives on your Linux box, no cloud nonsense.

## Stuff You Need

- A Discord account and a server you can boss around (admin rights).
- Internet to grab Discord’s bot setup.
- A terminal and like 5 minutes to yeet this bot alive.
